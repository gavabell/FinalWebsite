    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>I'm currently a student at Castle High School and also attend the Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center (SICTC), where I focus on developing my skills in software and web development. I have experience coding in Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and block-based programming, and I enjoy learning how to build both functional and visually appealing applications.

      Outside of school, I play lacrosse for my high school team, which has helped me build strong teamwork and time management skills. Once the lacrosse season wraps up, I'm planning to find a summer job to gain work experience and continue growing both personally and professionally.

    <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
    <p> For my education, I'm hoping to attend an in-state college such as USI, UE, IU, or Purdue, and major in business or economics. After college, I plan to pursue a career related to my major or work toward starting my own business. Eventually, I hope to retire somewhere niceâ€”like Florida.
