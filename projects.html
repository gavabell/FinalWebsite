  <!-- Project 1 -->

    <h4>Password Manager</h4>
    <p>I created a password manager that securely stores and retrieves login credentials. The main goal of the program is to help users manage their passwords more efficiently and safely by keeping everything encrypted and accessible through a single master password. One of the key features is the ability to generate strong, random passwords, which helps prevent users from reusing weak or common passwords.</p>

    <h4>Pong</h4>
    <p>I built a simple Pong game using just Python. The game is a two-player version where each player controls a paddle, trying to keep the ball from getting past them while aiming to score points. The game runs in a basic window and includes features like real-time ball movement, paddle control, and scorekeeping.

      Through this project, I learned how to manage game logic using Python, including how to update the positions of objects, handle collisions, and refresh the screen in real-time. I also worked on implementing basic input handling for user control and maintaining smooth game flow.
      
      This project helped me improve my understanding of game mechanics, real-time programming, and how to build interactive applications using only core Python.</p>

    <h4>Snake</h4>
    <p>I created a Snake game using just Python. In this game, the player controls a snake that grows longer each time it eats food, while avoiding crashing into walls or its own tail. The goal is to eat as much food as possible while preventing the snake from running into obstacles.

      Building this project helped me learn how to manage real-time game logic, including handling the snake's movement, collision detection, and keeping track of the score. I also worked on implementing user input for controlling the snake's direction and ensuring smooth gameplay by refreshing the screen continuously.
      
      This project deepened my understanding of basic game development concepts, like handling user input, working with simple graphics, and creating a game loopâ€”all using only Python without any external libraries.</p>
